                    My interest in programming technology began when I was 14, during a school group project. We were involved in a state wide competition called ‘RoboCup Junior’. Groups of students from various schools around the state had the opportunity to build and program our own robot that would dance to music. The end goal of the project was to enter the competition in dance-off’s against the other state schools, which had a chance to go Australia wide.

                    During my school years I also discovered that I had an interest for drama and performing. I had the opportunity to join a group of like minded students at Shopfront Theatre where I was able to be involved in multiple live performance productions, which I had acted in, and contributed to the writing and production of. Such performances were; The Tuesday Clan (2006) in which I had my own segment called ‘Caroline’s Commute’, The Nimbs (2007), and Villainous Business (2008). One of the performances I was a part of was a street performance called Lost Toy Story (2008) performed on the streets of Hurstville. During my final year at Shopfront I was involved in another couple of projects which were amateur short films; I.R.L (2009), Remove Before Show (2009), and Studio09 (2009).

                    During my final years of school and onwards, I’ve had a few different types of jobs. I began working in various fast food restaurants, including Pizza Hut. After completing my HSC I decided to try my hand at something completely different and spent a few months working in a factory for Patti’s Hire.

                    After trying out various types of work, after school I decided I wanted to further my education. This lead me to completing a Certificate IV in Information Technology (Web Design) at TAFE, achieving distinctions and credits for most units. I found my time at TAFE to be the most enjoyable year of my life as it allowed me to dive straight into developing practical skills that were relevant to the career I want to pursue. In order to gain further qualifications in the field I moved to Brisbane, Queensland, to attend university at Queensland University of Technology. University has given me the opportunity to explore different options and aspects of information technology.

                    During my time in Brisbane I also worked part-time as an administration assistant at Guardian Childcare Alliance. It was this job that really emphasised my interest in working with technology as it opened up chances for me to work with databases and data management. This was also my first opportunity to work in an office environment where I could learn to become more professional and gain a deeper understanding of how a company operates on a business level.

                    I have since moved back to Sydney and I am continuing my university degree and have participated in a university program called Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE). During this time I have also discovered my passion for coding extends to video game development. Recently I had competed in a video game development competition held by Western Sydney University, and supported by Wargaming.Net. The competition required us to build a video game in Unity and complete a 5 minute presentation of our game. I had placed 3rd in this competition and received an award. Since then I have been working on personal projects in order to develop my programming and web development skills.
